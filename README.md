Cumulative updates are updates that bundle multiple updates, both new and previously released updates. Cumulative updates were introduced with Windows 10 and have been backported to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.

## How do Microsoft cumulative updates work?

Both Windows client and Windows Server use the cumulative update mechanism, in which many fixes to improve the quality and security of Windows are packaged into a single update. Each cumulative update includes the changes and fixes from all previous updates.

* Go to Control Panel - Administrative Tools - Services.
* Scroll down to Windows Update in the resulting list.
* Double click the Windows Update Entry.
* In the resulting dialog, if the service is started, click 'Stop'
* Set Startup Type to Disabled.

## What is difference between cumulative and security update?

cumulative update is marked as a required security update, the PC needs to reboot to complete the installation. On-demand updates are also cumulative, but they are often marked as non-security updates and don't require a reboot.

## Difference Between Windows and Cumulative Update Windows 10

###Cumulative updates:

Due to the rapid ongoing development of various components of Windows 10, Microsoft shakes hard-hitting updates exceptionally frequently. Many times they have to face different types of trouble after getting different machines. After doing every possible research on bugs and errors, Microsoft sends out one more update to fix bugs and errors and makes them a cumulative update.

### Windows Update: 

You all know the update is a packed OS holding the replete installation and program files furthermore the bundle of Update files.

The cumulative update comprises only the patches that could fix the bugs, unlike the updates comprising a full package of the OS plus additional program development files.

Cumulative updates (CU) rather hold smaller magnitude than that of Windows updates.
